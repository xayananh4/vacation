     <h1>Why You Should Visit Ibiza</h1>
     <p>
        Ibiza is iconic for many reasons – the White Isle is still indisputably the top party 
        destination in Europe. DJs travel the world to play at its world-famous nightclubs, 
        chic beach clubs and banging pool parties. But what many first-timers don’t know is that 
        there’s a tranquil side to this Balearic island, too, where hippy-ish yoga retreats meet sleek 
        boutique hotels, and family-friendly Spanish beaches set the scene for some of the 
        Mediterranean’s best sunset views. Here’s why you should visit Ibiza
